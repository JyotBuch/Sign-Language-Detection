# Hand Sign Language Classification

*Self Learning Project*

## Project Description
Since the pandemic, it has been rather difficult, for the ones with the disability of speech. Since all meetings have moved towards online platoforms, why not make online communication easier for them by creating a tool which recognized hand sign alphabets and actions. The purpose of the project is to identify different hand signs and actions.

## Scope
Applications of Data Science are very vast ranging from finance and healthcare, to sports and agriculture. This is because, every second we have a large amount of data being generated. Since this data is used in so many important industries, why not make this data advantageous to the disabled. Due to the availability of various images and videos of hand signs and gestures, we can now train a model using CNN, where it can identify and classify these signs. In this model, we are identifying Hand Sign Alphabets from A-Z excluding J as it is in gesture format. This will help the user to communicate despite their disability, and make their work more fluent and efficient in the online world.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help the disabled communicate better with a wider audience.

## Tools Used
1. Python - Used as programming language as it very powerful and has many libraries for data science making it one of the most convinient languages for data scientists.

2. Tensorflow - A google developed open source software library, used for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

3. Sci-kit - Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.

4. OpenCV - OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

## Future Scope
Possible future work would include designing smart systems that can detect and explain the hand signs and gestures of these people to their audience so that language will no longer be barrier for communication. This can be implemented in online video conferencing platforms to booking and reservation systems as well.
